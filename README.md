Learn about Apache Iceberg.

Iceberg is a table-format built for big data analytics. Iceberg uses SQL-like tables with snapshotting, schema evolution, partitioning, and ACID compliance and can be queried by Spark, Trino, or Flink.

The [tabulario/spark-iceberg docker-compose file](https://hub.docker.com/r/tabulario/spark-iceberg) is a quick way to get Iceberg running using a Spark cluster and an Iceberg catalog.
